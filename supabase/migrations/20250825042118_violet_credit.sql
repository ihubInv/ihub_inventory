  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies are causing infinite recursion when querying any table
    - The error occurs because policies reference the users table in a circular way

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing policies that cause recursion
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies using only auth.uid()
    - Avoid any subqueries or references to other tables in policy conditions

  3. Security
    - Maintain basic security with simplified policies
    - All authenticated users can access data (can be refined later)
    - Focus on fixing the recursion issue first
